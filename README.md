# Mashacre

🎮 **About This Game**

The Mashacre is the chaotic result of a YouTube coding battle: “ChatGPT vs Gemini: Make Vampire Survivors From Scratch (Potato Edition).” Gemini won the battle, so the time limit was removed and the AI was forced to keep building until a fully playable, starch-filled bullet heaven emerged.

🏆 **The Recipe for Victory**
1. Mow down hordes of Rotten Potato enemies.
2. Defeat all 3 Boss Chefs to prove you can’t be peeled.
3. Summon the Mash King and mash him before he mashes you.

⌨️ **Controls**
- **W/A/S/D** or **Arrow Keys** — Move your potato
- **Mouse Cursor** — Aim your Ketchup Laser Beam
- **Left Click** — Select upgrades
- **Esc** — Pause / Settings (Volume)

🕹️ **Cheats / Debug**
- **`** (tilde): Opens the Cheats/Debug Menu (invincibility, force spawns, level skips). Use at your own risk—spawning 1,000 bosses may crash everything.

🧰 **What’s Inside**
- Potato-themed bullet heaven with evolving weapons, bosses, and spatula quests.
- Optimized level-up UI, potato-toned HUD, and performance-focused rendering.
- Fully client-side (HTML/JS/CSS); runs in browser.
