# Mashacre

🎮 **About This Game**
The Mashacre is the chaotic result of a YouTube coding battle: “ChatGPT vs Gemini: Make Vampire Survivors From Scratch (Potato Edition).” Gemini won the battle, so the time limit was removed and the AI was forced to keep building until a fully playable, starch-filled bullet heaven emerged.

🏁 **Quick Start**
- Click **Code → Download ZIP**, extract, then double-click [index.html](index.html) to play in a modern browser.
- If your browser blocks local files, run from the project folder: `python -m http.server 8000` and open http://localhost:8000
- Pure HTML/JS/CSS—no build step or extra dependencies.

🏆 **The Recipe for Victory**
1. Mow down hordes of Rotten Potato enemies.
2. Defeat all 3 Boss Chefs to prove you can’t be peeled.
3. Summon the Mash King and mash him before he mashes you.
