# Mashacre

🎮 **About This Game**
Mashacre is a Vampire Survivors-style project that started as an AI-built prototype from a YouTube coding battle. I’m now recoding and expanding it by hand. The original video is by PromptPotatoGames, and the first AI-made version lives on itch: https://promptpotatogames.itch.io/

🏁 **Quick Start**
- Click **Code → Download ZIP**, extract, then double-click [index.html](index.html) to play in a modern browser.
- If your browser blocks local files, run from the project folder: `python -m http.server 8000` and open http://localhost:8000
- Pure HTML/JS/CSS—no build step or extra dependencies.

🏆 **The Recipe for Victory**
1. Mow down hordes of Rotten Potato enemies.
2. Defeat all 3 Boss Chefs to prove you can’t be peeled.
3. Summon the Mash King and mash him before he mashes you.

✨ **Latest Changes**
- Ending screen now shows the main potato wearing a fedora (cartoony/homemade style).

- Additional UI polish while keeping the potato aesthetic.

🔭 **Future Updates**
- More end scenario variations and celebratory effects.
